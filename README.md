Graph Algorithms Library

This repository contains implementations of fundamental graph algorithms in Java. The primary aim is to provide clear examples of how each algorithm can be implemented and used.

Contents
BreadthFirstSearch: Implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
DepthFirstSearch: Implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
DijkstraSearch: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths.
Edge: Class representing an edge in the graph.
Vertex: Class representing a vertex in the graph.
MyGraph: Class representing an unweighted graph.
WeightedGraph: Class representing a graph with weighted edges.

Features

Breadth-First Search (BFS): An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, starting from the root node and exploring all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
Depth-First Search (DFS): An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, starting from the root node and exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
